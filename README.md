Whatsapp bot using whatsapp web scraping

## Getting Started

We can use this library in Flutter as well as Pure dart projects , checkout dart [example](https://github.com/rohitsangwan01/whatsapp_bot_flutter/blob/main/example_dart/main.dart)

First launch on Desktop apps will take some time, it will download chromium files locally, using [puppeteer](https://pub.dev/packages/puppeteer)

## Usage

Get `WhatsappClient` using connect method

```dart
// use WhatsappBotFlutterMobile.connect for Mobile platforms
WhatsappClient? whatsappClient = await WhatsappBotFlutter.connect(
  onConnectionEvent: (ConnectionEvent event) {
    print(event.toString());
  },
  onQrCode: (String qr, Uint8List? imageBytes) {
    // use imageBytes to display in flutter : Image.memory(imageBytes)
    print(WhatsappBotFlutter.convertStringToQrCode(qr));
  },
);
```

We have these modules to access whatsappClient features :

```dart
WhatsappClient.chat
WhatsappClient.contact
WhatsappClient.profile
```

Use `sendTextMessage` to send a text message

phone parameter can be of this format : `countryCode+phoneNumber` , eg : `91xxxxxxxxxx` , or we can get phone from messageEvents in this format : `countryCode+phone+"@c.us"`

```dart
await whatsappClient.chat.sendTextMessage(
    phone: "------",
    message: "Test Message",
);
```

Use `sendFileMessage` to send a File

```dart
await whatsappClient.chat.sendFileMessage(
    phone: "------",
    fileBytes: fileBytes, // Pass file bytes
    caption: "Test Message", // Optional
    fileType: fileType, // document, image, audio
);
```

To get new Messages , subscribe to `whatsappClient.messageEvents`

```dart
whatsappClient.messageEvents.listen((Message message) {
    // replyMessageId  is optional , add this to send a reply message
    whatsappClient.chat.sendTextMessage(
      phone: message.from,
      message: "Hey !",
      replyMessageId: message.id,
    );
});
```

To get whatsapp connection Events , subscribe to `whatsappClient.connectionEventStream`

```dart
whatsappClient.connectionEventStream.listen((event) {
  // Connection Events : authenticated,logout,connected.....
});
```

To get whatsapp calls Events , subscribe to `whatsappClient.callEvents`

```dart
whatsappClient.callEvents.listen((event) {
  // To reject call
  whatsappClient.chat.rejectCall(callId: event.id);
});
```

## Mobile Setup (Android/IOS)

To setup on Android , make sure to checkout `flutter_inappwebview` documentation for [Android](https://inappwebview.dev/docs/intro#setup-android) and [IOS](https://inappwebview.dev/docs/intro#setup-ios) setup
Android sdk:minSdkVersion cannot be smaller than version 19

## Desktop setup (Windows/Mac/Linux)

For Macos , Enable outgoing and incoming connections, If getting sandbox issue , try disabling sandbox mode comment this out in macos/Runner/\*.entitlements:

```
<key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>
<true/>
```

Should run out of the box in Windows and Linux

## Web setup

If getting an error while running on web , try to Add js Script in web/index.html from [Web](https://inappwebview.dev/docs/intro#setup-web) setup

To run on web platform, we have to run a chrome server somewhere using [puppeteer](https://pub.dev/packages/puppeteer), and get `browserWsEndpoint` from there and pass into the connect method

checkout [this](https://github.com/rohitsangwan01/whatsapp_bot_flutter/blob/main/example/puppeteer_server/main.dart) example of running a chrome server using puppeteer

then pass this `browserWsEndpoint` in connect method, and also requires `wppJsContent`, we can download this file from [here](https://github.com/wppconnect-team/wa-js/releases/latest/download/wppconnect-wa.js), add this file in assets and pass like this,

```dart
await WhatsappBotFlutter.connect(
    browserWsEndpoint: "BROWSER_WS_ENDPOINT_URL",
    wppJsContent: await rootBundle.loadString("assets/wpp.js"),
);
```

We can use this on `Mobile` or `Desktop` platforms as well , to connect to a chrome server hosted somewhere else

If we have to access this webSocket url locally on Mobile or other platforms , we can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose our local Websocket url to internet

## Note

Its just initial version, I can't guarantee you will not be blocked by using this method, try to avoid primary whatsapp numbers. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn't be considered totally safe.
